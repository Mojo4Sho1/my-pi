# DECISION_LOG.md

Append-only record of durable project decisions. Do not rewrite prior entries except to correct factual errors. Mark superseded decisions with `[superseded by #N]`.

When making a new decision, append it to the end with the next number.

## Decisions

### 1. Behavioral steering field is `working_style` (2026-03-08) [active]

Use `working_style` (not `persona`) to keep steering implementation-oriented.

### 2. `working_style` required for specialists (2026-03-08) [active]

Required for specialists, optional for other agent classes until formally upgraded.

### 3. Live state owned by `STATUS.md` (2026-03-08) [active]

Single live-state control plane prevents drift. Originally `docs/handoff/`, simplified to root `STATUS.md`.

### 4. `PROJECT_FOUNDATION.md` is stable architecture only (2026-03-08) [active]

Not a live state source. Live state belongs in `STATUS.md`.

### 5. Top-level `skills/` and `prompts/` are first-class package areas (2026-03-08) [active]

Matching package config and project scope.

### 6. Template contract/index must match actual structure (2026-03-08) [superseded by #12]

Templates archived as part of extension pivot. No longer actively maintained.

### 7. Phase transition to primitive implementation confirmed (2026-03-07) [active]

Confirmed after documentation stabilization.

### 8. Initial specialist set fixed to planner, reviewer, builder, tester (2026-03-07) [active]

Minimum roles to prove the team abstraction.

### 9. Canonical project foundation path is `docs/PROJECT_FOUNDATION.md` (2026-03-07) [active]

### 10. Startup flow: `AGENTS.md` → `INDEX.md` (2026-03-07) [active]

`AGENTS.md` is auto-read first by platform behavior. `INDEX.md` is the universal routing entrypoint.

### 11. Only orchestrator-class actors have broad default routing (2026-03-07) [active]

Downstream actors are narrow by default.

### 12. Pivot to extension-powered orchestration (2026-03-21) [active]

Build TypeScript Pi extensions implementing orchestrator/specialist routing as sub-agents with packet-based delegation and state-machine routing. Contracts and packet validation implemented in TypeScript types and runtime validation. Markdown agent definitions remain as specs that extensions implement. Governance documentation simplified heavily; archived files preserved in `docs/archive/`.

### 13. Consolidate decision tracking into single file (2026-03-22) [active]

Merged `docs/CANONICAL_DECISIONS.md` into root `DECISION_LOG.md`. Single source of truth for all decisions with `[active]`/`[superseded]` status markers. Archived the former file.

### 14. Standardized I/O contracts for all primitives (2026-03-26) [active]

Every primitive (specialist, team, sequence) declares an **input contract** (what it requires in its TaskPacket) and an **output contract** (what it guarantees in its ResultPacket). This applies at every layer:

- **Specialists** declare typed input requirements and typed output schemas (e.g., planner outputs `{ steps, dependencies, risks }`, builder outputs `{ modifiedFiles, changeDescription }`)
- **Teams** are opaque to the orchestrator — the orchestrator sends a team-level TaskPacket and receives a team-level ResultPacket. Intra-team communication is the team's responsibility; the orchestrator only evaluates the outcome.
- **Sequences** compose teams/specialists using the same contract model. Each stage's output contract must satisfy the next stage's input contract.

**Why:** Token efficiency (orchestrator doesn't see intra-team traffic), composability (teams and specialists are interchangeable from the orchestrator's perspective), and machine-checkable validation (contracts can be verified at transition points).

**Rejected alternative:** Passing all prior results to all downstream actors. This creates O(n²) context growth and couples the orchestrator to specialist internals.

**Implementation:** Contracts will be formalized in Stage 4 as part of team routing. Selective context forwarding (Stage 3c.1) is the tactical first step.

### 15. Selective context forwarding between specialists (2026-03-26) [active]

In multi-specialist orchestration, each downstream specialist receives only the context it needs from prior results — not all prior ResultPackets. The orchestrator maps prior outputs to downstream inputs based on specialist type.

**Why:** The current approach of passing all `priorResults` to every specialist creates ~40-50% waste in context tokens. A planner's output is irrelevant to a tester; a builder only needs the plan summary, not the planner's metadata.

**Implementation:** Stage 3c.1 implements a context mapping function. Stage 4 formalizes this as part of I/O contracts.

### 16. Meta-teams produce full implementations, not just specs (2026-03-26) [active]

Meta-teams (specialist-creator, team-creator, sequence-creator) output complete, working implementations — not just definition specs. For a specialist-creator team, that means: agent definition markdown, TypeScript extension code, prompt config, and tests.

**Why:** A spec-only output creates a second manual implementation step that defeats the purpose of self-expansion. The system should be able to create and validate new primitives end-to-end.

**Bootstrapping constraint:** The specialist-creator team may require specialists that don't exist yet (e.g., a spec-writer or scaffolder). These prerequisite specialists must be built manually before the creator team can function. After bootstrap, the creator team can sustain itself.

**Ordering:** Specialist-creator first (Stage 5a), then team-creator (5b), then sequence-creator (5d). Each validates the layer below.

### 17. Slash commands are `/plan`, `/next`, and `/specialist` — not per-specialist (2026-03-26) [active]

The system will NOT register per-specialist slash commands (`/build`, `/review`, `/test`, `/plan-specialist`). Instead, three higher-level commands:

- **`/plan`** — Interactive planning session. User discusses goals with the agent, then the orchestrator selects and invokes the appropriate primitives to execute. This is the primary entry point for new work.
- **`/next`** — Resume an existing plan/campaign from the repo. Orchestrator reads plan state, determines next steps, and executes using available primitives. This is the entry point for continuing work across sessions.
- **`/specialist`** — Interactive discussion about whether a new specialist is needed. Evaluates the gap, checks for redundancy against existing specialists, and delegates to the specialist-creator team (5a) if approved.

**Why:** Per-specialist commands assume the user knows which specialist to invoke. The orchestrator's job is to make that selection. `/plan` and `/next` let the orchestrator do its job. `/specialist` is the user-facing entry to the self-expansion capability.

### 18. Expand specialist set with spec-writer and critic (2026-03-26) [superseded by #20]

Original decision called for spec-writer and critic. Superseded by Decision #20 which defines the full 9-specialist roster.

### 19. Seed-creator team on roadmap (2026-03-26) [active]

A meta-team that creates seeds (reusable bootstrap context packs for setting up project repos). Seeds include instructions (`SEED.md`) and associated template files. Seeds can target fresh repos or forked repos, and will eventually cover non-project use cases too.

**Why:** Seeds are a distinct output type from specialists/teams/sequences, but the creation workflow is similar: design → write spec → create templates → review → validate. The seed-creator team uses the full specialist roster.

**Placement:** Added as Stage 5 item. Depends on specialist-creator team (5b) proving the meta-team pattern.

### 20. Full 9-specialist roster (2026-03-26) [active]

Supersedes Decision #18. The system's specialist roster expands from the initial four (Decision #8) to nine. Each specialist has a distinct reasoning posture — the test for inclusion is whether its cognitive mode cannot be achieved by prompting another specialist differently.

| # | Specialist | Reasoning posture | Distinct from |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **planner** | Step sequencing, dependency ordering, workflow design | — |
| 2 | **spec-writer** | Prose definitions, agent boundaries, working style, "what this does NOT do" | planner (thinks in steps, not boundaries) |
| 3 | **schema-designer** | TypeScript types, packet shapes, I/O contracts, invariants, failure modes, output templates, validation constraints | spec-writer (prose specs); builder (implements, doesn't design types) |
| 4 | **routing-designer** | State machines, transition completeness, escalation paths, unreachable state detection | builder (would implement routing as side effect, not inspectable design artifact) |
| 5 | **builder** | Code implementation — translates specs/schemas/routes into working TypeScript | — |
| 6 | **critic** | Scope evaluation, redundancy detection, reuse search, "should this exist?" | reviewer (pass/fail on acceptance criteria, not big-picture evaluation) |
| 7 | **boundary-auditor** | Access control, minimal-context enforcement, permission review, control philosophy compliance | critic (checks design quality); reviewer (checks deliverable correctness) |
| 8 | **reviewer** | Pass/fail gatekeeping against specific acceptance criteria | — |
| 9 | **tester** | Validation authoring, test writing, conformance checking | — |

**Naming decision:** "schema-designer" (not "contract-writer") because the scope covers types, packets, contracts, templates, and validation shapes — not just contracts. Pairs with "routing-designer" as a fellow design-time specialist.

**Tier 2 fold-ins (capabilities absorbed into existing specialists rather than getting their own):**
- Packet design → folded into schema-designer (packets are typed structures)
- Validation authoring → folded into tester (similar pass/fail reasoning posture)
- Reuse scouting → folded into critic (redundancy detection is already in critic's lens)

**Deferred specialists (real need, premature as standalone):**
- Registry-curator — better handled by tooling until primitive count exceeds ~15-20, then revisit
- Doc-sync auditor — valuable once creator teams generate primitives faster than humans review; revisit when self-expansion is operational

**Bootstrapping:** Five new specialists (spec-writer, schema-designer, routing-designer, critic, boundary-auditor) must be manually built in Stage 5a before the specialist-creator team (5b) can function. After bootstrap, the creator team can sustain itself.

### 21. Extended state machine with loop transitions and fan-out (2026-03-26) [active]

Team routing uses the existing state machine model extended with two additions:

1. **Loop transitions** — A state can transition back to an earlier state (e.g., `critique → revise_spec → critique`). A `maxIterations` guard on loop edges prevents infinite cycles. When iterations are exhausted, the team escalates.
2. **Fan-out states** — A state type that dispatches to multiple specialists and collects results before transitioning. Enables patterns like "critic reviews spec and schema in parallel."

**Critic pass-through:** When the critic has no revisions, it returns `status: "success"` and the state machine transitions forward normally. The loop only activates on `partial`/`failure`.

**Why extended state machine (not DAG):** The state machine is already proven, handles the required patterns (linear, branching, loops), and is incrementally extensible. A DAG-based model would be more expressive but requires a larger rewrite. If the state machine proves limiting in practice (e.g., complex dependency graphs between parallel branches), a DAG model is the natural evolution path.

**Rejected alternative:** DAG-based routing. Deferred as a potential future evolution if the extended state machine proves insufficient.

### 22. Critic reviews artifacts individually with upstream context (2026-03-26) [active]

The critic specialist reviews artifacts one at a time (not batched), but receives relevant upstream context for each review. For example, when reviewing a spec, the critic's task packet includes the plan summary the spec was derived from, enabling alignment checks.

**Why individual reviews:** Narrow context per review (matches narrow-by-default principle), clear traceability (each review produces a distinct result packet tied to a specific artifact), and targeted revisions (if one artifact needs rework, it's clear which one).

**Why upstream context:** Reviewing a spec in isolation misses alignment issues. The critic needs to verify that the spec faithfully implements the plan, so it needs the plan as context. This is the same pattern as selective context forwarding (Decision #15) — each specialist gets only the upstream fields it needs.

**Not a manifest approach:** The critic does not receive a manifest of all artifacts. It receives only the specific upstream artifact(s) relevant to its current review task.

### 23. Intra-team revision loops (2026-03-26) [active]

When a critic (or reviewer) identifies issues with an artifact, the team router sends the critique back to the original author as a new TaskPacket with the critique in the context field. The author revises and the critic re-reviews. This is a loop in the team's state machine.

**Max-iteration guard:** Each loop edge in the state machine has a `maxIterations` limit (e.g., 2-3 revision cycles). When exhausted, the team escalates to the orchestrator rather than looping forever.

**Escalation as safety valve:** If the critique is severe (fundamental scope problem, not a fixable revision), the critic returns `status: "escalation"` which exits the team entirely. The orchestrator decides what to do.

**Why intra-team (not escalation-first):** Keeps the team opaque to the orchestrator (Decision #14). The orchestrator sends a task in and gets a result out — it doesn't need to know about internal revision cycles. The revision logic stays where the domain knowledge lives.

### 24. Stage 4 scope: 4a + 4b together (2026-03-26) [active]

Stage 4a (I/O contracts) and 4b (team router) are implemented together. Contracts without a router are types with no consumer; a router without contracts has nothing to validate.

Stage 4c (schema validation) and 4d (observability) follow as a separate pass — they are independent of 4a/4b and benefit from having both contracts and router available to validate against.
